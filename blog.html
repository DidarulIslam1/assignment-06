                <b>#var:</b>
                var was the original way to declare variables in JavaScript.
                It has function scope, which means that the variable is visible throughout the entire function in which
                it
                is defined, regardless of block boundaries.
                If you define a variable with var outside of any function, it becomes a global variable, visible
                throughout
                the entire program.
                <br>
                <b>Advantages:</b>
                It is available in all versions of JavaScript, making it compatible with older codebases.
                It can be useful when you specifically want a variable to have function-wide scope or to be a global
                variable.
                <br>
                <b>Recommendations:</b>
                Avoid using var in modern JavaScript code, as it has some quirks and can lead to unintended issues.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>#let:</b>
                let was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) to address some of the issues with var.
                It has block scope, which means the variable is only visible within the block (statement or expression,
                as well as loops and conditionals) where it is defined.
                <br>
                <b>Advantages:</b>
                It prevents variable hoisting and allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the
                block, statement, or expression on which it is used.
                It's a good choice when you want to declare a variable that will be reassigned later.
                <br>
                <b>Recommendations:</b>
                Use let when you need a variable that might be reassigned.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>#const:</b>
                const is also introduced in ES6.
                It is used to declare constants, which are variables that cannot be reassigned after they are initially
                assigned a value.
                Like let, const also has block scope.
                <br>
                <b>Advantages:</b>
                It helps prevent accidental reassignment of a variable, which can lead to bugs and unexpected behavior.
                It communicates to other developers that a particular variable is meant to be constant.
                <br>
                <b>Recommendations:</b>
                Use const when you have a value that should never change throughout its lifecycle in the program.

                <br>
                <b>#null:</b> null is explicitly assigned to a variable or property to indicate that it has no value or
                it is intentionally empty.
                <br>
                <b>Use cases of null:-</b>
                <br>
                <b>Intentional Absence of Value:</b> It's often used to represent the intentional absence of any object
                value or value itself.
                <br>
                <b>Resetting or Clearing a Variable:</b> Sometimes, you might set a variable to null when you want to
                clear it or reset it.
                <br>
                <b>Returning Indicative Value from a Function:</b> A function might return null to indicate that it
                couldn't produce a meaningful result.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>#undefined:</b> undefined is a variable that hasn't been assigned a value yet, or hasn't been
                declared at all. When you declare a variable but don't assign a value to it, it is automatically
                assigned the value undefined.
                <br>
                <b>Use Cases of undefined:-</b>
                <b>Variable Declaration without Initialization:</b> When you declare a variable but don't assign a value
                to it, it is automatically assigned the value undefined.
                <br>
                <b>Function Parameters without Arguments:</b> If a function is defined with parameters but called
                without providing the expected number of arguments, the missing parameters will have the value
                undefined.
                <br>
                <b>Accessing Non-Existent Properties:</b> If you try to access an object property that doesn't exist, it
                will return undefined.
                <br>
                <b>Return Value of Functions without Explicit Return:</b> If a function doesn't explicitly return a
                value, it implicitly returns undefined.

                <b>REST API:</b> REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface.
                It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs are based on a set of
                principles that describe how networked resources should be defined and addressed. RESTful APIs are
                widely used in web development because they are flexible, scalable, and easy to understand. They are the
                foundation of many modern web services and are used to enable communication between different systems
                over the internet.
